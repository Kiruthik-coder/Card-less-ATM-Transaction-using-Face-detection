# Card-less-ATM-Transaction-using-Face-detection

<p align="justify">The project is based upon a Physiological biometric system that employs physical characteristics
of the user for the purpose of identification and authentication of the user. The importance
of Facial Recognition is being integrated with many applications under the field of security
monitoring and surveillance systems, in order to protect users data and decrease the malicious
activity happening from a third party. The main perspective of our project is we are going to
develop and implement Cardless ATM Transaction technology which recognizes the face of a
particular user, authenticating the user by matching it through the enrolled image and allowing
the user to perform transactional operation. The outcome which we are going to achieve after
developing the project, we can increase vulnerability for the users to secure their confidential
resources, also decreasing the number of fraudulent transactions which are currently increasing
day by day</p>
